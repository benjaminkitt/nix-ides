2. **Repository Maintainers**: People responsible for keeping the packages updated and working
3. **IDE Developers**: Those who may need to understand how their software is packaged

## Success Metrics

1. **Update Speed**: How quickly new IDE versions are available after upstream release
2. **Build Success Rate**: Percentage of updates that build successfully without manual intervention
3. **Platform Coverage**: Successful builds across all supported architectures
4. **User Adoption**: Number of users relying on the repository for their IDE needs
