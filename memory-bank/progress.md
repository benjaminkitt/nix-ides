# NixIDE: Progress Tracking

## Current Status

The project is in the initial setup phase. The Memory Bank has been established to track project information and progress. The core repository structure has been created with all necessary directories and configuration files.

## What Works

1. **Core Repository Structure**
   - Basic directory structure is in place
   - flake.nix and default.nix are initialized
   - GitHub workflow files are set up
   - README.md with usage instructions is created
   - .gitignore file with appropriate entries is added

## What's Left to Build

### High Priority

1. **Core Repository Structure** âœ…
   - [x] Create basic directory structure
   - [x] Initialize flake.nix
   - [x] Set up GitHub workflow files

2. **Update Scripts**
   - [ ] Implement VS Code update script
   - [ ] Implement Windsurf update script
   - [ ] Implement Cursor update script
   - [ ] Implement Zed update script

3. **Build Testing**
   - [ ] Configure PR testing workflow
   - [ ] Set up Cachix integration
   - [ ] Implement multi-platform build matrix

### Medium Priority

1. **Documentation**
   - [ ] Create comprehensive README
   - [ ] Document update process
   - [ ] Provide troubleshooting guidance

2. **Optimization**
   - [ ] Refine update detection logic
   - [ ] Optimize build times
   - [ ] Improve error handling

### Low Priority

1. **Additional Features**
   - [ ] Add support for more IDEs
   - [ ] Implement notification system for failed builds
   - [ ] Create dashboard for update status

## Known Issues

As this is the initial setup, there are no known issues yet. Issues will be tracked here as they are identified during implementation.

## Recent Achievements

- Established Memory Bank for project tracking
- Defined project requirements and structure

## Next Milestone

Complete the core repository structure and implement the first update script (likely VS Code) to demonstrate the end-to-end workflow.
