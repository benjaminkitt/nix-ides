# NixIDE: Active Context

## Current Focus

The project is in its initial setup phase. The core repository structure has been established, and the focus is now shifting to implementing the automated update workflows for the supported IDEs.

## Recent Changes

1. Created the basic directory structure following Nix conventions
2. Initialized flake.nix and default.nix with appropriate skeleton content
3. Set up GitHub workflow files for update checking and PR testing
4. Created placeholder files for package definitions and update scripts
5. Added comprehensive README.md with usage instructions
6. Created .gitignore file with appropriate entries for Nix-related artifacts

## Next Steps

1. **Update Script Implementation**
   - Develop the update scripts for each IDE
   - Implement version detection logic
   - Create file fetching and modification functionality

2. **Build Testing**
   - Configure PR testing workflow
   - Set up Cachix integration
   - Implement multi-platform build matrix

3. **Documentation**
   - Document update process in more detail
   - Provide troubleshooting guidance
   - Add examples for manual operations when needed

## Active Decisions

1. **Script Implementation Language**
   - Python chosen for update scripts due to its readability and rich library ecosystem
   - Bash could be considered for simpler scripts if needed

2. **Update Frequency**
   - 4-hour interval chosen as a balance between timeliness and resource usage
   - May need adjustment based on actual IDE release patterns

3. **PR Strategy**
   - Individual PRs per package update for isolation and clarity
   - Auto-merge for successful builds to minimize manual work

4. **Architecture Support**
   - Focus on three main architectures: linux-x86_64, darwin-aarch64, darwin-x86_64
   - Some packages may not support all architectures

## Current Challenges

1. **Version Detection Complexity**
   - Each IDE may have different version reporting mechanisms
   - Need to develop robust detection for each package

2. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**
   - Ensuring builds work across all supported platforms
   - Handling platform-specific issues

3. **Nixpkgs Integration**
   - Correctly fetching and modifying nixpkgs files
   - Handling potential changes to nixpkgs structure

4. **Testing Efficiency**
   - Optimizing build times and resource usage
   - Ensuring thorough testing without excessive duplication
